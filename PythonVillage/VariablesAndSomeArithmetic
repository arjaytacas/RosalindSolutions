# Problem
# Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.
# Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b.

# Solution
# Using Pythagorean Theorem (a2 + b2 = c2) to solve this problem 

# Sample dataset have a=3 and b=5 with an output of 34

# Declare variables
a = 3
b = 5

# Writing the code
c2 = 3**2 + 5**2
